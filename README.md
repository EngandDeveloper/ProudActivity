# ProudActivity
A productivity tool designed with students in mind to enable the people achieve more dreams that they can be proud of.

## Purpose:

Help people use their time more productively through Pomodoro technique with a simple UI.
Also, make the most out of their day, I added a basic to-do list in order to keep track of tasks.

## Next Steps:

Add a GPA calculator for students to help them stay on top of their grades.
The GPA calculator will also have a goals section for enabling the students to constantly see their current GPA and compare
it with their dream GPA.

## What I Learned From This Project:

- Using the basic features of the Android built-in SQL database
- Supporting multiple activities
- Using the constraint layout to have a more responsive yet complex UI design
- Think more thoroughly on my code to achieve the intended results on much less capable and diverse hardware (compared to computers)
